#HERBS

Herbs stands for _Hopefully Exhaustive Ruby Benchmark Suite_. 

The idea behind this suite is to be as exhaustive as possible by benchmarking each standard Ruby class method.
The aim behind this work is to help Ruby implementers find slow spots in their product.
 
Ruby 1.9 classes and syntax ares used as a base for the benchmarks.
